📦 Smart IoT & QR-Based Fruit Basket Tracking System

This project is an IoT-powered smart basket system that ensures farm-to-market transparency for organic fruits.
Each basket is sealed with an IoT lock and a unique QR code, allowing only authorized users (farmers, officials, or shopkeepers) to open it.
All sealing and unlocking events are recorded with date, time, and user details on a web dashboard, preventing tampering and fraud.

✨ Key Features:

-> QR code–based basket identification

-> IoT-controlled smart lock (ESP32-CAM + relay)

-> Real-time tracking and database logging

-> Secure role-based access for users

-> Web dashboard for monitoring basket history

-> Return and reward system for reusing baskets

💡 Tech Stack:
IoT (ESP32-CAM, Relay, Servo), Python / Flask, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, SQLite

🎯 Goal:
To build a tamper-proof and transparent fruit delivery system that benefits farmers, prevents mixing of low-quality fruits, and ensures customers receive genuine organic produce.
